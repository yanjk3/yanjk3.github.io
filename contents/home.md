#### Biography

I am Junkai Yan, or you can call me Drinky. I graduated with a master's degree from the School of Computer Science and Engineering at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/) in June 2024, under the supervision of Professor [Wei-Shi Zheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AwqDDGoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Before graduation, I worked as a research intern at Alibaba TongYi Lab and subsequently joined a startup team initiated by my colleague from Alibaba Cloud. Unfortunately, I realized that entrepreneurship was not for me and decided to quit before long... 

Afterwards, I joined [Insta360](https://www.insta360.com/), a vibrant intelligent imaging company, as an algorithm engineer. Currently, I mainly focus on AI video editing technology. It's incredibly interesting to use our products for filming and apply the algorithms we've developed for editing. I thoroughly enjoy my current work and life!

#### Chatter

I bought an [Insta360 Ace Pro 2](https://www.insta360.com/product/insta360-ace-pro2)📷 and tricked it out to be "my first Leica-style camera as a youngster." I **aaaaaabsolutely** love using it to shoot videos when I go outting with my cute blue electric bicycle🛵 on weekends. And if you're looking to buy an action camera, I will say Ace Pro 2 is your **top choice**. I'm into basketball🏀 and a **hhhhhhuge** fan of Devin Booker📖, so I've got all sorts of colorful Booker One basketball shoes👟. **PPPPPPlus**, I'm a diehard McDonald' fan - I love burgers🍔, and I will never let my McDonald's O'McCard expire. Lastly, concat me via [drinkyyan@gmail.com](mailto:drinkyyan@gmail.com) if you want to contact me🤣.
